    "# Feature extraction\n",
    "Like many healthcare datasets, the Synthea dataset contains both \"vertical/longitudinal\" and \"horizontal\" tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Horizontal tables**\n",
    "\n",
    "Horizontal tables contain one row per patient. Each column provides a piece of information about that patient. A good example of this is the *patients* table where each column provides a demographic feature of the patient such as gender, race, and so forth. A more technical term for horizontal tables is first normal form (1NF).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vertical or longitudinal tables**\n",
    "\n",
    "Vertical tables are usually used to store logitudinal measurements and observations. Unlike horizontal tables, each patient can have multiple rows representing different measurements/observations at different times. An example is the *observations* table where each row can contain the result of a specific lab test. The *description* column provides the name of the lab test and the *value* column determines the outcome of the test. A more technical term for vertical tables is entity–attribute–value model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ML-ready table**\n",
    "\n",
    "You cannot directly train the regression model on the dataset as-is in BigQuery. Instead, you will have a simple horizontal table where each training example corresponds to a single row containing all of the data for one patient and each column corresponds to a feature. The name for this type of table is an *ML-ready table*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transformation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code extracts data from the source vertical and horizontal tables, joins them based on patient ID, and creates a single ML-ready table.\n",
    "To extract features from the vertical tables, a query is built that groups the rows by their description and aggregates the corresponding values into an array sorted by time. For each description that occurs at least 100 times, a new column is added to the ML-ready table, which will be a feature for the model. The name of the column comes from the description and the value of the column is the last value in the aggregated array. Therefore, for  each type of measurement, the last measurement is used as the value of the corresponding feature."
